# NftMetadataIndexerCoreUltra

## Description

A curated collection of NFT smart contracts and metadata schemas employing on-chain SVG rendering and decentralized storage via IPFS pinning with verifiable CID URIs, optimized for minimal gas consumption on L2 scaling solutions.

## Features

- Leverage parallel processing techniques with asynchronous task queues to expedite metadata indexing.
- Implement a robust caching mechanism using Redis to reduce database load and improve query response times.
- Utilize a distributed architecture with Kubernetes for scalability and high availability across multiple nodes.
- Employ advanced image recognition algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automatically extract relevant features from NFT images.
- Integrate with IPFS and Arweave to verify the integrity and permanence of NFT assets by validating content hashes.
- Provide a GraphQL API endpoint for efficient and flexible querying of indexed NFT metadata with custom filtering and sorting options.
- Develop a modular plugin system allowing for easy integration of new data sources and metadata extraction methods.
- Implement automated data validation routines to ensure data consistency and accuracy across different blockchain networks.
